# Clrtool

Clrtool is a cross-platform-native mobile application for extracting colorpalettes from photos previously taken or captured via the app itself.
Extracted palettes can easily be shared via one tap on the share button. The resulting colorscheme can then easily be
imported into Photoshop, Illustrator, etc..
